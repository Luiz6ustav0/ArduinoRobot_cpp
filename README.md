# ArduinoRobot_cpp
Code and information for Arduino Autonomous Robot(C++)

<b><i>This project requires some previous knowledge dealing with Arduino since I'm not going to explain everything here</i></b>
_____________________________________________________

The code for Arduino is pretty straightforward so you shouldn't have any problems following along with it.
Some extra information:
  - I used a L293D Motor Shield to connect to 6V DC motors and a servo motor
  - My project uses 2 9V batteries, one powers the arduino board and the other powers the motors and the servo
  - I recommend using capacitors in the motors
